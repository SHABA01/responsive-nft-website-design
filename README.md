## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learnt

In this project, I learned how to:

- Dynamically manipulate the DOM with JavaScript to create interactive features.
- Use event listeners to handle user interactions such as clicks and toggles.
- Apply conditional styling based on data attributes or states.
- Efficiently iterate over arrays to dynamically generate HTML content.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to further enhance my skills in:

- Implementing more advanced CSS techniques for layout and styling.
- Improving accessibility to ensure a better user experience for all users.
- Exploring frameworks or libraries to streamline development processes.
